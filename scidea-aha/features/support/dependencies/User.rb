class User

  # TODO How do I represent the difference between a 'registered' user and a 'guest' user in my object space, will i need factories for registered?
  # TODO Use inheritance to make user ROLES and TYPES (sa, cm, author,...) etc... on the fly populate them in the db with populator or factory girl
  # TODO Is there a DRYer way to instantiate domestic/intl users than passing the proper array in as an initialize parameter? (each time i create user i have to remember to select correct list)
